I recently created an interactive project streamed live on Twitch. I wanted to experiment with interactive art in new media and started working on a (what was supposed to be) simple pixel art board that viewers could interact with through stream chat commands.

## Pixel Art

I like pixel art. Despite its simple looks it's a fairly difficult medium forcing you to be creative by limiting details and encouraging imagination. I hesitated a long time, trying to find the perfect grid dimensions. Too large and it gets heavy, too small and it gets too hard to work with. I originally planned for a 16x16 grid but decided to give a bit more lee-way and went for a 20x20 grid.
